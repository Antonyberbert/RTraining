#Project Overview:

In the face of pressing environmental challenges, climate change mitigation has become a global imperative. This master project delves into the intricate intersection of climate change concerns and the democratic process, focusing on Switzerland as a case study. The primary objective is to understand the voting behavior of Swiss citizens concerning climate policies and to analyze the underlying reasons that influence their decisions.

#Project Details:

*1. Climate Change Mitigation as a Focus:* This project centers on climate change mitigation, acknowledging its critical role in safeguarding the planet for future generations. We explore the hypothesis that voting can serve as a potent avenue to advance climate-friendly policies and practices.

*2. Swiss Voting Behavior Analysis:* Switzerland's unique political landscape offers an intriguing backdrop for this research. By scrutinizing Swiss voting behavior, we aim to uncover trends, preferences, and potential disparities in climate policy support across different regions and demographics.

*3. Investigating Reasons Against Climate Policies:* A key aspect of this study involves delving into the motivations and concerns that lead individuals to vote against climate policies. Understanding these reasons is crucial for developing effective strategies to bridge divides and build consensus.

*4. Leveraging Large Language Models:* To gain comprehensive insights into the multifaceted reasons underlying voting behavior, we employ state-of-the-art large language models. These cutting-edge tools enable us to cluster and categorize diverse sets of reasons, shedding light on the complexity of public sentiment toward climate change policies.

#Expected Outcomes:

By the end of this master project, we anticipate uncovering valuable insights into the dynamics of climate change mitigation through the democratic process. We aim to provide data-driven recommendations for policymakers, advocacy groups, and the broader public, with the ultimate goal of fostering informed and effective climate policy decisions.

Through rigorous analysis, innovative methodologies, and a deep commitment to addressing climate change, this project seeks to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing global efforts to combat the climate crisis.

The categories on the x-axis represent various reasons, such as “Economical Reasons,” “Policy too extreme / too broad,” and “Switzerland has little impact.” The y-axis shows the frequency or number of responses associated with each reason.\nThe chart provides valuable insights into the key objections and concerns raised by respondents regarding the Co2-Gesetz. “Economical Reasons” emerges as the most frequently cited rationale, followed by other factors like “Unfair Policy” and “Against Tax.” Understanding these reasons is essential for policymakers and advocates seeking to address concerns and promote support for environmental policies.\n\n\n\n",

The primary\r\n              objective is to understand the voting behavior of Swiss\r\n              citizens concerning climate policies and to analyze the\r\n              underlying reasons that influence their decisions.\r\n              #Project Details:\r\n              1.

Swiss Voting Behavior Analysis:\r\n              Switzerland’s unique political landscape offers an\r\n              intriguing backdrop for this research.

Leveraging Large Language Models: To gain\r\n              comprehensive insights into the multifaceted reasons\r\n              underlying voting behavior, we employ state-of-the-art\r\n              large language models.
